### Description
My friend and I wrote this lab to introduce the basics of robotics and programming to high school physics students. This lab is meant to be completed over the course of about a week during the summer, or about three weeks during the school year. In the lab, each student (or pair of students) will construct and program a small semi-autonomous vehicle. The final section of the lab involves using all the created vehicles to recreate the classic Braitenberg AI experiment.

#### The completed robot looks like this:
